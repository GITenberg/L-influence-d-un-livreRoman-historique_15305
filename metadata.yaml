description: "The Influence of a Book (French: L'influence d'un livre) is a novel\
  \ by the Canadian writer Phillipe-Ignace François Aubert du Gaspé, first published\
  \ in 1837. It is considered to be the first French Canadian novel, and although\
  \ the book was not well received initially, it has come to be recognized as a major\
  \ landmark in Canadian literature.\nIt is the tale of Charles Amand's quest for\
  \ gold. Between alchemy, the courtship of his daughter Amélie, the legend of Rose\
  \ Latulipe and the murder of the peddler Guilmette, there is a satirical theme aimed\
  \ at spiritual poverty in Quebec.\nThe Influence of a Book, an English language\
  \ translation by Claire Rothman, was published in 1993 and won the John Glassco\
  \ Translation Prize in 1994.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
